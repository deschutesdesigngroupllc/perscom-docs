PERSCOM offers a powerful Discord integration that helps keep your organization up-to-date by providing login capabilities and sending important notifications to your end users.

## Notifications

A variety of PERSCOM services have the ability to send instant notifications. Use the steps below to configure notifications for Discord.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add The PERSCOM Bot To Your Server">
    Navigate to the `Settings` page and click `Integrations`. Make sure you are on the `Discord` tab. Select the enable button and click the + button next to the server selection dropdown. Follow the prompts to add the PERSCOM Bot to your Discord server.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Notification Channel">
    Once the PERSCOM Bot has been added to your Discord server, use the next dropdown to select the channel you would like to post all PERSCOM notifications too. These will be public notifications. For private notifications, a notification will be sent directly to the user using the Discord DM feature.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Optionally Configure Default Notifications">
    Notifications can be sent dynamically on a case-by-case basis, or they can be setup using a default configuration. Under the `Notifications` link, you can configure your default notification settings. To send to Discord, make sure to check the Discord channels for both Private and Public, depending on your wishes.
